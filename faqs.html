        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
         <section class="faq_body">
    <details>
        <summary>How many kitties are there?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Following North Carolina Law, we can have up to 12 kitties at a time.  All cats are spayed, neutered, fully vaccinated, and microchipped!</p>
        </div>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Can I bring my cat from home?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>While we love all cats, please leave your cat at home!  We have plenty that will want your undivided attention.</p>
        </div>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Do I need a reservation?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Yes! Often we are completely booked. Walk-ins are allowed when space is available, but that is extrememly rare. We encourage reservations above anything
                so that we can make sure we don't disappoint you.  Weekends, especially, can be booked as much as 3-4 weeks out, so please plan accordingly!

    <details>
        <summary>What can I expect when entering the Cat Lounge?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Cats are everywhere!  The Cat Lounge is 2 stories, and with 12 cats around there will always be someone to play with.  However, we ask
                that you be respectful and do not wake any sleeping kitties and picking up kitties is prohibited.  The best advice we can give is to find
                comfy spot and a toy, and see who comes to you!
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is there an age policy?</summary>
      <div>
          <p>Out of respect for other guest and safety of both the cats and little ones, children under 6 years of age can only be allowed in the Cat
            Lounge when the room is booked out by the entire family.  To book an entire room, a total of 8 individual spots must be filled.  Please ensure you have
            booked these sessions appropriately out of courtesy for our other visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
            For children aged 7-13, a waiver must be signed by an adult and that adult must accompany them at all times while they are at the Cat Lounge.
            For those aged 14-17, a waiver is still needed, but they are allowed in the Cat Lounge without supervision.

        <summary>I met the cat for me.  Now what?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>That's amazing news and exactly what we're here for.  Please go to our Adoption page and fill out the application.  They will contact you to discuss
                all the details and guide you through the process of bringing a new cat into your life!

        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <h3>As of 10/1/2023</h3>
        <p>We will no longer be offering parties or gatherings for guests under 13. Thank you for understanding. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
        </p>

        <h3>Currently</h3>
        <p>Our normal age policy is 7 and older but currently, YOUNGER GUESTS ARE PERMITTED! We just ask that you book all 8 spots in an hour
           so that you have the room to yourself ($104/weekday or $120 weekend). This is out of respect for our other guests who may or may not
            want to share the space with little ones. We appreciate your understanding of this policy!
        </p>

        <h3>Please Note</h3>
        <p>Due to the current economic climate, and our reduced booking capacity, RESERVATIONS WILL BE NON-REFUNDABLE and 
          NON-TRANSFERABLE if cancelled within 24 hours of your scheduled appointment! We thank you for your understanding of this policy.

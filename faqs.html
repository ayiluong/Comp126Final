      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <section class="faq_body">
        <details>
          <summary>How many kitties are there?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>There are so many kitties for you to play with! In accordance with North Carolina Law, 
              we can have up to 12 kitties at a time. All cats are spayed, neutered, fully vaccinated, and microchipped as well.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I bring my cat from home?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>While we love all cats, out of courtesy for our cats and yours, please leave your cat at home! We have
               plenty that will want your undivided attention.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Do I need a reservation?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Yes! We are often completely booked. Walk-ins are allowed when space is available, but that is extremely rare. 
              We encourage reservations above anything so that we can make sure we don't disappoint you. Weekends, 
              especially, can be booked as much as 3-4 weeks out, so please plan accordingly!</p>

        <details>
          <summary>What can I expect when entering the Cat Lounge?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Cats are everywhere! If you love cats, it'll definitely be a fun experience for you. The Cat Lounge is 2 stories, and with 12 cats around, 
              there will always be someone to play with. However, we ask that you be respectful and do not wake any sleeping kitties, and picking up
               kitties is prohibited. The best advice we can give is to grab a toy and a comfy spot and see who comes to you!</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is there an age policy?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Out of respect for other guests and the safety of both the cats and little ones, children under 6 years of age can only be allowed in the Cat Lounge 
              when the room is booked out by the entire family. To book an entire room, a total of 8 individual spots must be filled. Please ensure you have booked these 
              sessions appropriately out of courtesy for our other visitors.</p>
            <p>For children aged 7–13, a waiver must be signed by an adult and that adult must accompany them at all times while they are at the Cat Lounge. 
              For those aged 14–17, a waiver is still needed, but they are allowed in the Cat Lounge without supervision.</p>

          <summary>I met the cat for me. Now what?</summary>

            <p>That's amazing news and exactly what we're here for. Please go to our rescue sight <a href = "https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/CTNC/Cat">Adoption Page</a> and fill out the application. They will contact you to discuss all the details and guide you through the process of bringing a new cat into your life!</p>

      <section class = "news">
        <h3>As of 10/1/2023</h3>
        <p>For guests under 13 years of age, we will no longer be hosting parties or gathers. Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for understanding.</p>  
      </section>

      <section class = "news">
        <h3>Currently</h3>
        <p>While the normal age policy is those 7+ years of age, YOUNGER GUESTS ARE STILL PERMITTED! However, we ask that if you are bringing a child under 7, that you 
          book all 8 spots available in an hour so you can have the entire space to yourselves ($104/weekday or $120 weekend).  While we appreciate
          sharing the kitties with your little ones, this is also out of respect for our other guests. We appreciate your understanding!</p>

      <section class = "news">
        <h3>Please Note</h3>
        <p>Due to the current economic climate, and our reduced booking capacity, to protect our business RESERVATIONS WILL BE NON-REFUNDABLE and NON-TRANSFERABLE if cancelled within 24 hours of your scheduled 
          appointment!</p>

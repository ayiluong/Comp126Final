        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <h3>As of 10/1/2023</h3>
        <p>We will no longer be offering parties or gatherings for guests under 13. Thank you for understanding. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
        </p>

        <h3>Currently</h3>
        <p>Our normal age policy is 7 and older but currently, YOUNGER GUESTS ARE PERMITTED! We just ask that you book all 8 spots in an hour
           so that you have the room to yourself ($104/weekday or $120 weekend). This is out of respect for our other guests who may or may not
            want to share the space with little ones. We appreciate your understanding of this policy!
        </p>

        <h3>Please Note</h3>
        <p>PLEASE NOTE: Due to the current economic climate, and our reduced booking capacity, RESERVATIONS WILL BE NON-REFUNDABLE and 
          NON-TRANSFERABLE if cancelled within 24 hours of your scheduled appointment! We thank you for your understanding of this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Pawse...</h2>
        <p>Before visiting Cat Tales Cat Cafe in Chapel Hill, make sure to reserve your visit online in advance.
            Each session lasts for one hour and costs $13 per person on weekdays and $15 per person on weekends, with a portion supporting the care and adoption of the cats. 
            Guests must be at least 7 years old to enter the Cat Lounge; younger visitors are welcome only through private bookings (limited to a max of 8). Walk-ins are accepted if space allows, but advance reservations are strongly recommended to secure your preferred time, especially on weekends.

        <h2>Guidelines for a PAWsitive experience</h2>
        <h3>For the health of the cats, please wash hands and/or use sanitizer before entering the Cat Lounge. We also ask that you remove shoes. We offer clean socks to borrow or encourage you to bring your own. Our cats are neat freaks. </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Please do not wake a sleeping cat. They play hard and need to sleep hard, and we respect that. </li>
        <li>Please do not pick up the cats. It's much more rewarding when they come to you. If you are interested in getting to know a particular cat better, please ask the Cat Lounge Concierge for assistance. </li>
        <li>We also ask that you not play with toys on our stairs or our lookout ledge area. The safety of everyone is our number one priority!</li>
        <li>The cats will try to convince you that they are allowed to enjoy human treats. They are not. Don't be persuaded by purrs and slow blinks. </li>
        <li>Please do not let the cats out of the Cat Lounge. They do not need to explore Franklin Street.</li>
        <li>Please remember this is the cats’ home and we will always have new arrivals who are still adjusting. We want to keep it a low stress environment so please keep voices low and movements calm. Leave the zoomies to the cats.</li>
        <li>Have fun! Enjoy the cats and their antics, or their snuggles. And feel great knowing you are making a difference in their lives. </li>
    </ul>

            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>At Cat Tales, "Every kitty has a story." We treat every kitty with our absolute care, and we make sure that no matter where they come and what condition they are in,
                each one is happy, healthy, and comfortable as they enter the next chapter of their life.  We strive to provide a safe and loving environment for these cats as they
                await their new lives.  We see it as a privilege to accompany these kitties on their journey and see them to their full potential!

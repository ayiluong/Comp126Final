        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Here at Cat Tales Cafe we provide a low-stress environment for kitties looking for a new home.
          You can come cuddle up to a new friend, have a drink (wine, beer, and coffee are all served),
          and help to socialize the cats so that they're ready for their forever homes. We currently are 
          home to 12 terrific kitties, and if you fall in love with any of them, you can adopt your soul-cat!
          Please go to our <a href = "https://www.cattalesrescuenc.com/">rescue website</a>
          to start the adoption process. 
        </p>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
          First, make a reservation. During the week, reservations are $13 per person and $15 on the weekends. 
          If you wish to bring along a child under 7, we require that you book the entire room. Our capacity is 
          8 adults per hour, but to book a gathering of more than 8 please call (843)-345-5289. When you get here,
          simply check-in at the front and then enjoy your time with the kitties! Drinks are available, as well
          as lots of toys. You will have an hour to sit, hang-out, and meet all of our purr-fect cats.
